You might wonder how good you are doing with the implementation of DevOps principles in your organization. And, that is very good! It probably means that you want to improve it.

To see how good you are doing and if you are improving anything or not you have to measure it. So, here are the 4 key metrics of DevOps you can measure over time and see how you are doing.

1. **Deployment frequency:** the frequency at which new releases go to production.
2. **Lead time for changes:** the time until a commit goes to production.
3. **Mean time to restore:** the time it takes to resolve a service impairment in production.
4. **Change failure rate:** the ratio of deployments to production that leads to errors and successful deployment.
