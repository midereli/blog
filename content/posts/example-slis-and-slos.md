When implementing SRE principles in an organization, we must firstly define SLIs (service level indicators) and SLOs (service level objectives).

Service level indicators (SLIs) are measurable, quantitative aspects of a service. Some basic examples include:

* Error rates
* Latency
* Availability
* Throughput

Service level objectives (SLOs) are a target value for a service that are measured by defined SLIs. Some basic examples include:

* %99 of HTTP 200 requests are below 200 ms
* percentage of HTTP 500s < %0.1
* number of daily tickets < 5
* paging events per shift < 2

After defining SLIs and SLOs now comes the SLAs. A service level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client.
